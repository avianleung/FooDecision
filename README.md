# Restaurant Swiper

Essentially Tinder for restaurants

### What the app does
Many couples have a serious problem when deciding where to eat. This app solves this issue. It scrapes yelp for addresses of the top 30 highest reated restaurants in your location. Then these addresses are passed to the Google Maps API and information about the restaurant including their hours of operation, rating, and pictures are returned from the API response. Then the restaurants on rendered on the frontend similar to how Tinder is and users will "swipe" on restaurants. At the end, all approved restaurants are compiled, and users can ask to randomly choose one or choose one on their own!
